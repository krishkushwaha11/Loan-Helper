                        <p>We understand that not everyone has excellent credit. The truth is that the majority of Americans have low enough scores that it is either difficult or impossible for them to find funding from a bank or credit union. That doesn’t sit right with us.</p>
                        <p>All credit types are welcome on Loans Request. It is our mission to help you gain access to a high-quality financial product, no matter what your credit score may be.</p>
